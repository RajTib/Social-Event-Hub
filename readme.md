## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many people, especially introverts or newcomers in cities, struggle to find events that match their comfort level.  
Current platforms:
- Focus mostly on mainstream/popular events.
- Lack emotional understanding — they don’t adapt to the user’s mood or anxiety level.
- Provide limited interactivity before events, leaving people hesitant to join.

**Result:** Reduced social participation, missed networking, weaker community bonding.

## 💡 Solution (MVP)
We’re building an **AI-powered event hub** that:
- Recommends events based on **user mood & interests**.  
- Shows events on **interactive maps**.  
- Lets users click **“I’m Interested”** to RSVP quickly.  
- Generates **AI-driven icebreakers** to ease social interaction.  

> The hackathon MVP focuses on the full loop: Mood → Event Recommendations → Map → Interested Button → Icebreaker.
